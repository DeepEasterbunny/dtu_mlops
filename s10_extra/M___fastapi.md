We can develop an application programming interface (API) that provides the appropriate level of abstraction for 

We will be designing our API around an client-server type of of architechture: the client (user) is going to send *requests* to a server (our application) and the server will give an *response*. For example the user may send an request of getting classifing a specific image, which our application will do and then send back the response in terms of a label.
