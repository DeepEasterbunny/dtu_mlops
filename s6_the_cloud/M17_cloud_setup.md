Go to the [signup site](https://cloud.google.com). Signup for free with your google account. This will give you $300 in starting credit. If you at some earlier point have already used these credits, please just create a new google account and signup. Note that you will have to give a credit card info (to check that you are not a bot). They should not charge you except if you choose to upgrade, but else remember to remove your card info when the course is over.

One way to stay organised within GCP is to create projects. Create a new project called `dtumlops` as shown in the image below.
