# Reproduceability

Today is all about reproducibility - one of those concepts that everyone agrees is very important and something
should be done about, but reality is that it is very hard to secure full reproducibility.

For the first set of exercises we have provided a single script. Your task is to use Hydra to make sure that everything
gets correctly logged such that you would be able to exactly report to others how each experiment was configured. In the
provided script, the hyperparameters are hardcoded into the code and your job will be to separate them out into a 
configuration file.
