# 2. Getting started with MLOps - Organization

This set of exercises focus on getting organized and making sure that you are familiar with good development
practices. While this may not seem that important, it is crucial when working in large groups that the difference
in how different people organize their code is minimized. Additionally, it is important for the reproducibility
of results to be able to accurately report the exact environment that you are using. Try to think of your computer
as a laboratory. If others were to reproduce your experiments, they would need to know the exact configuration of your
machine that you have been using, similar to how a real laboratory needs to report the exact chemicals they are using.
This is one of the cornerstones of the [scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method)

A lot of the exercises in this course are very loosely stated (including the exercises today). You are expected to
seek out information before you ask for help (Google is your friend!) as you will both learn more for trying to
solve the problems yourself and it is more realistic of how the "real world" works.



## Extra

While we in this course focus on git/version control for keeping track of code changes, it can also
be extended to keep track of changes to data, model ect. 

In this extra exercise you are encouraged to checkout https://github.com/iterative/dvc which works
similar to git but focuses on version control for machine learning.
