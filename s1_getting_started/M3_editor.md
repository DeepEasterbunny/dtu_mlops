Notebooks can be great for testing out ideas, developing simple code and explaining and visualizing certain aspects
of a codebase. Remember that [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) was created with intention to "...allows you 
to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text." However, 
any larger machine learning project will require you to work in multiple `.py` files and here notebooks will provide 
a suboptimal workflow. Therefore, to for truly getting "work done" you will need a good editor / IDE. 

Many opinions exist on this matter, but for simplicity we recommend getting started with one of the following 3:

Editor		         | Webpage  	                  			| Comment (Biased opinion)
-------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------
Spyder             | https://www.spyder-ide.org/        | Matlab like environment that is easy to get started with
Visual studio code | https://code.visualstudio.com/     | Support for multiple languages with fairly easy setup
PyCharm            | https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/ | IDE for python professionals. Will take a bit of time getting used to

We highly recommend Visual studio code if you do not already have a editor installed (or just want to try something new.).

### Exercise

1. Download and install one of the editors / IDE and make yourself familiar with it e.g. try out the editor
   on the files that you created in the final exercise in the last lecture.

The remaining of the exercises are specific to Visual studio code but we recommend that you try to answer the questions
if using another editor.
