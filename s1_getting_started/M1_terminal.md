Contrary to popular belief the terminal is not mythical being that have existed since the dawn of time. 
Instead it was created at a time where it was not given that your computer had a graphical interface that
you could interact with. Think of it as a text interface to your computer.

It is a well known concept to users of linux, however MAC and Windows users not so much. Having a basic understanding 
of how to use a terminal can really help improve your workflow.

#### Exercises

1. Open a terminal 

2. (Windows users) We highly recommend that you activate *Windows Subsystem for Linux*. Please follow this 
   [guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). Remember to run commands from a elevated
   (as administrator) powershell. This is optional because many of the command that we use are available through
   a standard Windows terminal, but some are not.
