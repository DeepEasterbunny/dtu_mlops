# 08. Model deployment

Lets say that you have spend 1000 GPU hours and trained the most awesome model that you want to share with the
world. One way to do this is of course to just place all your code in a github repository, upload a file with
the trained model weights to your favorite online storage (assuming it is too big for github to handle) and
ask people to just download your code and the weights to run the code themself. This is a fine approach in small
research setting, but in production you need to be able to **deploy** the model to a environment that is fully 
contained such that people can just execute without looking (too hard) at the code.

The main focus today is to solve the exercises that has to do with Azure. The remaining two are not strictly
required but will introduce you to the concept of data drifing and how to natively serve pytorch models.

## Deployment on Azure

We are going to continue with Azure, where we this time focus on deploying a trained model

1. Complete this [exercise](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/register-and-deploy-model-with-amls/5-deploying-a-model)

2. Afterwards answer [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/register-and-deploy-model-with-amls/5a-knowledge-check)
   knowledge check.
   
3. Finally, try to deploy either your MNIST model or the model in your own project

4. (Optional) If you have deployed a model on Azure try to get someone else from the course to consume it through 
   the [requests API](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) in python.

Here is the general [learning module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/build-ai-solutions-with-azure-ml-service/)
from Microsoft about deploying models to Azure, and below is listed a couple of reading resourses:

* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-deploy-azure-container-instance
