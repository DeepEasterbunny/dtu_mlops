# 5. Continue project work

Today is also dedicated to doing project work, so nothing new. Remember that the focus of the project is not
to demonstrate that you can work with the biggest and baddest deep learning model, but instead that you show
that you can incorporate the tools that are teached throughout the course in a meaningfull way.

### Project hand-in

By the end of the day (17:00) you should upload whatever you have done on the project until now to github, such
that we can asses that all groups have managed to get started with there project. You are not required to 
continuously upload your code to github, but we hope that you will naturally do this as part of the workflow.
